So i've done a bunch of stuff but basically I'm able to type 

node script.mjs "../permaculture/content/posts/" "permaculture" "principles,beginners" "How can I get a permaculture design certificate"

So this allows me to plug the website, topic, categories, subject in and have it produce an article
now i jsut need to setup a git folder that automatically adds new posts to the git repo and pushes it up



anyway so the post generator works really well
all i need to do now is have a regular cron setup and set posts to draft until reviewed
this cron should include the pipeline for enriching the articles, then publishing
